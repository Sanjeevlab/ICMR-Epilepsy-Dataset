Currently, the dataset is not fully open access due to institutional and ethical approval processes. However, discussions are in the final stages, and we aim to make the complete dataset publicly available through this GitHub repository.

To support early access and reproducibility, a **representative subset** of the dataset has been made available:

- The current subset contains **30 Epileptic** and **30 Control Healthy** subjects.
- Each subject's data is a **pruned 3-minute clean EEG recording**, selected from a longer **20 to 25-minute** session.
- The files are provided in **`.csv` format** with a **sampling frequency of 125 Hz**.
- Each file includes **17 EEG channels** in total.
- Some recordings have:
  - **complete EEG channels**, while others have
  - **even** and **odd** channel files:
    - **Even**: channels from the **left hemisphere** of the brain
    - **Odd**: channels from the **right hemisphere** of the brain

Please refer to the file naming and directory structure for details.
