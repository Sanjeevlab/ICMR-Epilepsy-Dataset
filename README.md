Currently, the dataset is not fully open access due to institutional and ethical approval processes. However, discussions are in the final stages, and we aim to make the complete dataset publicly available through this GitHub repository. To support early access and reproducibility, a representative subset of the dataset has been made available.
The current subset contains 30 Epileptic and 30 Control Healthy subjects.
Each subject data is the pruned 3 min clean recording from 20 to 25 min whole recoding.
The file is in .csv format with sampling frequency of 125 Hz. 
It has 17 channels in total.
Some recordings have comple channel file and some has even and odd files.
Here even means channels lying in the right hemisphere of brain whereas even means channels lying in the left hemisphere of brain.
